# Online Gambling Advertisment Image Prediction Using CNN

This model is built with a system that can predict images of online gambling ads and non-gambling ads using Convolutional Neural Network.


## This model project is built using:

- TensorFlow
- KERAS

## Step by Step

- Sample (Get the dataset)
- Explore (Explore the dataset, find an anomaly, image cleaning)
- Modify (Normalitation, Labelling, Split)
- Model (Create model using CNN Architectur Standard using TensorFlow - KERAS)
- Access (Train the model (epoch 10,15,20), evaluation, prediction)
